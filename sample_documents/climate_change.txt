Climate Change and Global Warming

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns. Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the mid-20th century due to increased levels of greenhouse gases produced by human activities.

The primary greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases. Carbon dioxide is the most significant greenhouse gas, primarily released through burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.

Effects of climate change include rising sea levels, changing precipitation patterns, more frequent extreme weather events, and shifts in ecosystems. These changes can impact agriculture, water resources, human health, and biodiversity.

Mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and developing carbon capture technologies. Adaptation measures involve building resilient infrastructure and developing climate-resistant agricultural practices.
