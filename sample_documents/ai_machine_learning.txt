Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has been particularly successful in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Common applications of AI and ML include recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and virtual assistants. The field continues to evolve rapidly with new techniques and applications being developed regularly.
